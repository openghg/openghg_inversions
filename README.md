## About 
Python code for performing inversions of atmospheric species with options for using either the University of Bristol Atmospheric Chemistry Research Group (ACRG) Hierarchical Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (HBMCMC) model or the UK Met. Office Inversion Technique for Emission Modelling (InTEM) model. See below for references to each of these models. 

OpenGHG is used for the underlying data processing of the inversion models. Please ensure you are familiar with OpenGHG (particularly the use of the “objectstore”) before proceeding. 

## Setup

## Getting Started
Once setup, ensure that your OpenGHG objectstore is setup and configured as detailed in the OpenGHG tutorials. Make sure any data (e.g. measurements, footprints, flux files) have been added to the OpenGHG objectstore before proceeding with the inversions.
