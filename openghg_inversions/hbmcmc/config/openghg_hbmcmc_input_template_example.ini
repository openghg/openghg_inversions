[MCMC.OPTIONS]
; averaging_error (bool): Add variability in averaging period to the measurement error (Note: currently this

; min_error (float): value specifying a lower bound for the model-measurement mismatch error (i.e. the error on
;                    (y - y_mod)). Ignored if compute_min_error = True.

;                                 file provided by the Met Office (from their "InTem" model), and the "inner
;                                 region", which includes the UK, is fit using our basis algorithms.
; use_bc (bool): defaults to True. If False, no boundary conditions will be used in the inversion. This
;                implicitly assumes that contributions from the boundary have been subtracted from the
;                observations.
; nuts_sampler (str): defaults to "pymc". The other option is "numpyro", which will the JAX accelerated sampler
;                     from Numpyro; this tends to be significantly faster than the NUTS sampler built into PyMC.
; save_trace (bool): If True, the arviz InferenceData output from sampling will be saved to the output path of
;                    the inversion, with a file name of the form f"{outputname}{start_data}_trace.nc.

; pollution_events_from_obs (bool): Determines whether the model error is calculated as a fraction of:

;                                   - the prior modelled enhancement (if False)
