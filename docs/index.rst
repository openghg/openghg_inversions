OpenGHG Inversions is a Python package that is being developed as part of the [OpenGHG project](https://openghg.org) with the aim of merging the data-processing and simulation modelling capabilities of OpenGHG with the atmospheric Bayesian inverse models developed by the Atmospheric Chemistry Research Group (ACRG) at the University of Bristol, UK.

Currently, OpenGHG Inversions includes the following regional inversion models:
