Concrete RHIME Model
====================

This page makes the model graph behind :func:`run_rhime` and
:func:`run_rhime_multisector` explicit. It has two purposes:

* show the concrete statistical model and its PyMC names;
* show how the standard model can be reconstructed from public component
  helpers.

The current builders
--------------------

Each recipe directly composes one readable concrete graph. The standard graph
lives beside :func:`run_rhime` in ``openghg_inversions.rhime.standard``; the
multisector graph lives beside :func:`run_rhime_multisector` in
``openghg_inversions.rhime.multisector``:

.. code-block:: text

   RhimeModelSpec + canonical inversion inputs
   -> concrete standard or multisector builder
   -> public linear-component helpers
   -> total flux contribution, mu
   -> boundary, offset, error, and likelihood components
   -> PyMC model

.. _rhime-builder-stability:

Stability contract
------------------

The concrete builders are the production reference implementations. Their
explicit PyMC code is the primary model definition for scientific review,
auditing, and user confidence. Shared source selection and ordinary scientific
components remain separate helpers, while model-specific composition stays in
the recipe that runs it.

Standard single-flux model
--------------------------

Let ``H`` be the flux sensitivity matrix with dimensions
``(region, nmeasure)`` in canonical inversion inputs. The builder transposes it
to observation-first order before registering it as PyMC data. The flux model
is

.. math::

   x &\sim p_x, \\
   \mu &= Hx.

With the default prior, ``x`` is the physical deterministic transform of a
standard-normal ``x_latent``:

.. math::

   x_{\mathrm{latent}} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1), \\
   x &= \exp(\mu_x + \sigma_x x_{\mathrm{latent}}).

When boundary-condition scaling is enabled,

.. math::

   bc &\sim p_{bc}, \\
   \mu_{bc} &= H_{bc}bc.

An optional global, site, or site-by-period offset contributes ``offset``. The
mean of the observed distribution is therefore

.. math::

   \mu_{\mathrm{obs}} = \mu + \mu_{bc} + \mathrm{offset},

where omitted components are left out of the sum.

The ordinary model preserves the pollution-event fractional-error equation
used by ``run_hbmcmc.py``. Aggregation error is disabled by default. Let
:math:`P` be the pollution event and let ``sigma`` be the observation-aligned
fractional model-error parameter. With the default
``pollution_events_from_obs=False``,

.. math::

   P &= |\mu|, \\
   \epsilon &= \max\left(
     \sqrt{\mathrm{error}^2 + (P\sigma)^{\mathrm{power}}},
     \mathrm{min\_error}
   \right), \\
   y &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{\mathrm{obs}}, \epsilon^2).

When ``pollution_events_from_obs=True``, the modern recipe derives the
pollution event from observations after removing the complete baseline,
including any boundary and offset contributions. Thus
:math:`P=|Y-(\mu_{bc}+\mathrm{offset})|` when a baseline exists; without one,
it uses :math:`P=|Y|+10^{-6}\operatorname{mean}(Y)`.

The ``run_hbmcmc.py`` compatibility path retains its historical boundary-only
variant: :math:`P=|Y-\mu_{bc}|`, even when an offset is also included in
:math:`\mu_{\mathrm{obs}}`. That exception preserves existing configurations;
it is not the scientific default for new RHIME recipes.

With ``no_model_error=True``, the sampled fractional-error contribution is
omitted and the likelihood scale is the observation error, protected only by
the historical very-small numerical floor. ``min_error`` is not applied in
that branch.

Aggregation covariance is an explicit advanced opt-in. If a caller selects a
prepared covariance :math:`C_{agg}` with marginal variance
:math:`v_{agg}=\operatorname{diag}(C_{agg})`, the marginal floor and observed
distribution become

.. math::

   v_{raw} &= \mathrm{error}^2 + (P\sigma)^{\mathrm{power}}, \\
   v_{ind} &= v_{raw} + \max\left(
     \mathrm{min\_error}^2-v_{raw}-v_{agg}, 0
   \right), \\
   \epsilon &= \sqrt{v_{ind}+v_{agg}}, \\
   y &\sim \mathcal{N}\left(
     \mu_{\mathrm{obs}}, \operatorname{diag}(v_{ind})+C_{agg}
   \right).

Selecting aggregation error says only that this fixed covariance should enter
the likelihood. It does not perform, imply, or verify a coherent prior and
forward-model transformation. Covariance obtained by marginalising native
states must therefore be supplied together with the matching transformed
prior and forward operator. Merely finding an aggregation-error array in
prepared inputs does not opt a run into this model.

The default priors are:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 42 38

   * - Quantity
     - Prior
     - PyMC variables
   * - Flux scaling
     - Lognormal with mean 1 and standard deviation 1, reparameterized
     - ``x_latent`` and ``x``
   * - Boundary scaling
     - Truncated normal with mean 1, standard deviation 0.05, and lower bound 0
     - ``bc``
   * - Model error
     - Uniform from 0.1 to 3
     - ``sigma``
   * - Optional site/global offset
     - Normal with mean 0 and standard deviation 1
     - ``offset_latent`` and ``offset``

This table describes the Python builder default used when ``x_prior`` is
omitted. The shipped RHIME config template instead supplies an explicit
``x_prior`` without ``reparameterise=True``. That config therefore creates
``x`` directly, without ``x_latent``. Add ``"reparameterise": True`` to the
config prior to request the API-default parameterization shown here.

The important default model-data and deterministic names are:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 24 30 46

   * - Name
     - Role
     - Canonical input
   * - ``hx``
     - Flux design data
     - ``H``
   * - ``mu``
     - Flux contribution
     - ``hx @ x``
   * - ``hbc``
     - Boundary design data
     - ``H_bc``
   * - ``mu_bc``
     - Boundary contribution
     - ``hbc @ bc``
   * - ``Y``
     - Observed mole fraction data
     - ``mf``
   * - ``error``
     - Observation error data
     - ``mf_error``
   * - ``min_error``
     - Minimum error data
     - ``min_error``
   * - ``epsilon``
     - Observation-aligned error scale
     - RHIME error model
   * - ``y``
     - Observed random variable
     - Normal likelihood

Equivalent construction from public helpers
-------------------------------------------

The default production builder constructs the graph in the same direct style
shown below. A researcher does not need to construct a private plan to write an
equivalent concrete single-flux model. The following uses public component
helpers:

.. code-block:: python

   import pymc as pm

   from openghg_inversions.models import (
       CoordRegistry,
       add_linear_component,
       attach_coord_registry,
   )
   from openghg_inversions.models.likelihoods import add_gaussian_observation_likelihood
   from openghg_inversions.models.pollution_event import build_pollution_event_error
   from openghg_inversions.sigma import SigmaAlignment

   x_prior = {
       "pdf": "lognormal",
       "mean": 1.0,
       "stdev": 1.0,
       "reparameterise": True,
   }
   bc_prior = {
       "pdf": "truncatednormal",
       "mu": 1.0,
       "sigma": 0.05,
       "lower": 0.0,
   }
   sigma_prior = {"pdf": "uniform", "lower": 0.1, "upper": 3.0}

   sigma_alignment = SigmaAlignment.from_frequency(
       inv_inputs["site_indicator"],
       frequency=None,
       per_site=True,
   )

   with pm.Model() as model:
       attach_coord_registry(model, CoordRegistry())

       flux = add_linear_component(
           inv_inputs["H"],
           data_name="hx",
           prior_args=x_prior,
           var_name="x",
           output_name="mu",
           output_dim="nmeasure",
       )
       boundary = add_linear_component(
           inv_inputs["H_bc"],
           data_name="hbc",
           prior_args=bc_prior,
           var_name="bc",
           output_name="mu_bc",
           output_dim="nmeasure",
       )
       pollution_mean = flux.output
       baseline_mean = boundary.output
       modelled_mean = pollution_mean + baseline_mean

       error_state = build_pollution_event_error(
           inv_inputs,
           pollution_mean=pollution_mean,
           pollution_event_baseline=baseline_mean,
           sigma_alignment=sigma_alignment,
           sigma_prior=sigma_prior,
           power=1.99,
           pollution_events_from_obs=False,
           no_model_error=False,
           aggregation_error_mode="none",
           output_dim="nmeasure",
       )
       add_gaussian_observation_likelihood(
           observed=error_state.observed,
           mean=modelled_mean,
           independent_variance=error_state.independent_variance,
           aggregation_error=error_state.aggregation_error,
           output_dim="nmeasure",
       )

This example is deliberately concrete and editable. It is suitable when a
model developer needs to change graph construction directly. It does not
automatically participate in the complete ``run_rhime`` output pipeline; that
pipeline still selects one of the built-in model builders.

Multisector model
-----------------

For the current shared-basis multisector model, each sector has an independent
state and forward contribution:

.. math::

   x_s &\sim p_s, \\
   \mu_s &= H_s x_s, \\
   \mu &= \sum_s \mu_s.

If the normalized PyMC suffix for sector ``s`` is ``ff``, its variables are
``x_ff`` and ``mu_ff`` and its design data is ``hx_ff``. Source values select
the corresponding ``H`` slices; sector names provide model identities. They
are not required to be the same strings.

Every sector state and every reparameterization-generated latent must have a
unique backend name. Concrete composition relies on PyMC to reject duplicate
generated names.

Names and generated names
-------------------------

PyMC model variables currently share one flat effective namespace. A prior can
create more names than the requested base name. In particular, a
reparameterized lognormal requested as ``x_ff`` creates both ``x_ff`` and
``x_ff_latent``.

Both names should be treated as reserved for that prior. No data variable,
other state, forward-term deterministic, or total should use either name. PyMC
enforces this during concrete composition. The shared observation-component
helper still relies on conventional names for boundary, offset, error, and
likelihood components; there is not yet one allocator for the complete model
namespace.

Generated-name reporting, whole-model allocation, and component namespaces are
not implemented. They are tracked in
`issue #532 <https://github.com/openghg/openghg_inversions/issues/532>`_.

Alternative models and likelihoods
----------------------------------

Direct-Python likelihood builders enter through ``run_rhime``,
``run_rhime_multisector``, or ``run_rhime_from_prepared_inputs``.
Complete-model builders remain available only at the prepared-input boundary.
Callables are never read from configuration or stored on ``RhimeModelSpec`` or
``RhimeRunSpec``, so model and run specs remain serializable. There is no
entry-point or config-file plugin registry.

A concrete recipe owns the complete forward-model mean: pollution, baseline,
and optional offset contributions are composed visibly before the likelihood
seam. A likelihood builder owns error construction and the observed
distribution. RHIME passes the completed concentration, pollution contribution,
pollution-event baseline, prepared observations, sigma alignment and prior, error
policies, aggregation-error mode, and output dimension as explicit arguments.
The builder adds and returns the canonical observed variable ``y`` and also
adds the canonical marginal error scale ``epsilon``.

The editable example in :doc:`customising_rhime` combines the reusable
additive-sigma error component with a Gaussian likelihood. Pass that adapter
directly to the ordinary runner:

.. code-block:: python

   from my_project.likelihoods import additive_sigma_likelihood_builder
   from openghg_inversions.rhime import run_rhime

   result = run_rhime(
       config_file="config.ini",
       likelihood_builder=additive_sigma_likelihood_builder,
   )

This model adds ``sigma**2`` to observation-error variance and supports the
same explicitly selected fixed aggregation covariance representations. It is
not part of the ordinary pollution-event-scaled model.

Pass ``add_offset=True`` and ``offset_args={"per_site": False}`` as Python or
configuration options to combine it with one global scalar offset. The
default ``per_site=True`` retains the existing site or site-period offset
design.

Keep scientific customization implementations in one tested location. The
:doc:`customising_rhime` guide contains the editable Student-t example and the
minimal ordinary-runner call; this concrete-model page does not duplicate it.

Ordinary likelihood builders keep the ``y`` and ``epsilon`` names used by
sampling and postprocessing. The runner records the likelihood builder's
module and qualified name, so direct-Python likelihoods remain identifiable in
persisted inversion outputs.

A complete model builder instead receives a ``RhimeModelBuilderContext``. It
contains the validated ``RhimePreparedInputs``, updated ``RhimeRunSpec``, and
the validated single- versus multi-sector mode. The builder returns a
``RhimeModelBuildResult``:

.. code-block:: python

   from importlib.metadata import version

   import pymc as pm

   from openghg_inversions.rhime import (
       RhimeModelBuilderContext,
       RhimeModelBuildResult,
       run_rhime_from_prepared_inputs,
   )
   from openghg_inversions.models import (
       CoordRegistry,
       add_coords,
       attach_coord_registry,
   )


   def complete_model(
       context: RhimeModelBuilderContext,
   ) -> RhimeModelBuildResult:
       data = context.prepared_inputs.inv_inputs
       with pm.Model() as model:
           attach_coord_registry(model, CoordRegistry())
           add_coords(data.coords, model_dims=("nmeasure",))
           mean = pm.Normal("custom_mean", mu=0.0, sigma=10.0)
           pm.Normal(
               "custom_y",
               mu=mean,
               sigma=data.mf_error.values,
               observed=data.mf.values,
               dims="nmeasure",
           )
       return RhimeModelBuildResult(
           model=model,
           variable_roles={
               "observation": "mf",
               "observation_error": "mf_error",
               "concentration": "custom_y",
           },
           supported_output_formats=("none", "inv_out"),
           metadata={
               "package": "my-rhime-models",
               "version": version("my-rhime-models"),
               "model": "complete_model_v1",
           },
       )


   result = run_rhime_from_prepared_inputs(
       prepared_inputs=prepared,
       run_spec=run_spec,
       model_builder=complete_model,
   )

The compatibility rules are explicit:

* a complete builder must return a concrete ``pm.Model`` and a non-empty role
  manifest; ``concentration`` is required;
* every declared role name must exist in either the model or prepared inversion
  inputs;
* builders that use labelled model dimensions should attach ``CoordRegistry``
  before calling ``add_coords`` or public model components, so
  ``RhimeSampler`` can restore MultiIndexes and auxiliary scientific
  coordinates;
* builder metadata must be JSON serializable, and external packages should
  record their package version and stable model identity there;
* custom builders support only ``output_format="none"`` unless they explicitly
  declare more formats; declaring a format promises that the trace, roles,
  basis layout, and variables required by that output really are present;
* ``model_builder`` and ``likelihood_builder`` are mutually exclusive; and
* a component that does not exist, such as inferred model error in a fixed-error
  model, is omitted from the role manifest rather than represented by a magic
  name.

The built-in standard and multisector builders produce the same
``RhimeModelBuildResult`` contract on ``RhimeResult.model_build_result``. Their
sector roles use keys such as ``flux_scale:FF`` and
``flux_contribution:FF``. The low-level recipe builders return a plain
``pm.Model``; the corresponding ``*_model_result`` wrappers add the runner and
output metadata contract.

The more general semantic model and observation-channel representation remains
tracked in `issue #528 <https://github.com/openghg/openghg_inversions/issues/528>`_.

Customization boundaries
------------------------

The current customization levels are:

Supported high-level options
   Priors, boundary conditions, offsets, sigma alignment, and existing error
   options supplied through the public RHIME builders and model spec.

Supported low-level components
   Public functions in ``openghg_inversions.models`` can be composed inside a
   user-owned ``pm.Model`` as shown above.

Recipe-local model composition
   Copy or modify the readable concrete builder in
   ``openghg_inversions.rhime.standard`` or
   ``openghg_inversions.rhime.multisector`` when an existing option or shared
   component is insufficient.
